      <h2>The Girl with the Golden Heart <br><small>by Rebecca Dell</small></h2>
      
      <p class="intro">You know her as the MU swimmer from ESPN's January "Outside The Lines" report, which told the story of her 2011 suicide. The media has linked Sasha Menu Courey inseparably to rape, mental illness and Title IX. But there's much more to her story. Her death brought two families colliding together, and her legacy lives on in Pat Healy, who received her heart.</p>

		<p class="intro">It started in Massachusetts.</p>

		<h4>Fall 2005: The gene pool</h4>
		<p>Pat Healy couldn't stop coughing.</p>

		<p>As midterms loomed, the University of Massachusetts sophomore shrugged off the pneumonia or whatever it was and pushed through his tests.</p>

		<p>But the coughing eventually drove the Massachusetts native to seek a diagnosis. Pat, 20 at the time, told the doctor at the hospital about his family: His mom had a heart transplant when he was in second grade. She died when he was a freshman in high school. His younger brother had heart issues, too. They were swimming in the wrong end of the gene pool, Pat says.</p>
